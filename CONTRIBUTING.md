# How to add to our repo
## Step 1. Create a new branch within the format of department/user/feature
  For example, Coding/happiness/jukebox or writing/hoa/scene1 or audio/kier/SFXScene1
  
## Step 2. commit your changes using git bash or github desktop

## Step 3. After all the changes are done for the department, Happiness+ (Programming Director) or Sagi (Scripting Lead) will merge the changes to the master branch.
