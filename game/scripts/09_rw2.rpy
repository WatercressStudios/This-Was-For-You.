    "How long has it been since I moved from this bed?"

    "My body feels heavy. Like I'm being pulled down by an anchor."

    "I don't need to go anywhere. The \"scenery\" here isn't too bad."

    "The predictability and periodic nature of the dull fan is comforting."

    "You'd hate this scenery, Ji."

    "You'd search every crook and cranny of that fan to uncover some spontaneity and color."

    "And you'd find it."

    "Just like you had for the people around you."

    "I head over to my fridge and pull it open, the glow from the fridge illuminating my dark kitchen."

    "It doesn't taste of anything. The pizza."

    "If it isn't so easy to get them delivered, I wouldn't have had any in my fridge - I've never liked pizza, even when I was a kid."

    "It's one of the many ways I was different from everyone else growing up."

    "I wasn't the sort of kid who would get excited over a new cartoon or video game."

    "I was the type who'd read novels at home in the lounge with my parents."

    "Or who would help my parents bake pastries and build a doghouse."

    "I liked doing things my parents enjoyed."

    "...Maybe that was why I was so bad at making friends - I had trouble connecting with people my age."

    "Though that changed after I met you, Ji."

    "Your ability to connect with everyone and everything rubbed off on me."

    "Even your curiosity was infectious. My co-worker was surprised when I asked them about their weekend."

    "And now I have a small circle of friends. People I actually like."
