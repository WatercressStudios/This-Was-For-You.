label rw4:
    # MC did not receive a notification of "New voicemail!" for this voicemail (just vary up how they leave VR a little)

    # POWER BLACKOUT! Whatever BG they where on, it suddenly turns black.
    # play SFX of a VR headset being powered down (it'll be cool if we can have a TV blinking off visual effect to go with it)
    # also hide the menu buttons (temporarily, for a few seconds)
    # show BG of the bedroom…. but it's almost complete black, from darkness

    "What? What happened?"

    # sfx of a thunder, followed by a BG change to the window and sfx of MC sitting up on bed. it's also super dark out there.

    # flash the lightning outside the window! a second of two later, play sfx of another thunder.

    # sfx of the VR headset powering on, and the room goes to normal brightness again
    # the UI menu fades back into view, indicating the power is back on

    "...a blackout?"
    "Haven't had that in awhile."

    # ding! new voicemail

    "At least the power's back on. Or are we on a generator right now? I don't actually know if we even have one. Not that it matters."

    # sfx for "access denied" or "cannot access this UI function at this time"
    "..."

    "I'm trying to go back into the VR world, but the button's greyed out."

    "It says \"Initializing…\" on the display."

    "Of course… it just had a hard reset from the blackout, so the headset needs time to boot up."

    "Dammit."

    "Joke's on me, huh."

    "...guess I should listen to this voicemail after all."

    # show the thumbprint scanner from the start of the game again, and animate it in the same way, to re-authenticate

    # fade to black screen for voicemail

    voice "13-rw4-1.mp3" #Friend ()
    vm "Heya! So uh, where do I start…"
    voice "13-rw4-2.mp3" #Friend ()
    vm "Right! I don't wanna call you out or anything, but you kinda missed our last four hangouts."
    voice "13-rw4-3.mp3" #Friend ()
    vm "Wait that counts as calling you out, isn't it? Sorry. *laughs*"
    voice "13-rw4-4.mp3" #Friend ()
    vm "So umm… your friends wanna see your stupid face."
    voice "13-rw4-5.mp3" #Friend ()
    vm "I'm sure you'll forgive us for tomorrow, cuz you're a good person."
    voice "13-rw4-6.mp3" #Friend ()
    vm "Also, you owe us one."
    voice "13-rw4-7.mp3" #Friend ()
    vm "Oh right, I forgot to mention… we're coming over tomorrow."
    voice "13-rw4-8.mp3" #Friend ()
    vm "Just the three of us, don't worry. Take care!"
    # abruptly hangs up, as if the caller was afraid the MC would say "no" even though it's a freaking voicemail

    # abruptly hangs up, as if the caller was afraid the MC would say "no" even though it's a freaking voicemail

    # fade back into the window scene, zoomed into the outside view. a lightning flashed and thundered again

    "...so it's come to this, huh."

    "My friends are no longer giving me a choice."

    "If I knew this was going to happen, I'd have replied to their emails."

    "...maybe."

    # lightning flash and sfx again
    # pause a second or two

    "Was it a mistake to tell them about Ji-min?"

    "They never understood my friendship with her."

    "And ever since I told them what happened, they've been treating me as if I've lost a lover."

    "\"Ji's my best friend,\" I've said countless of times."

    "They mean well, and to their credit, I think they do try. They just never had a close online friend themselves, so they can't relate."

    "And when they come tomorrow, I'll have to say it again."

    "...No."

    "This time, I'll have to say…she {b}was{/b}…my best friend."

    "..."

    # sfx of beeping sound indicating VR is ready to be launched

    "Shaking my head, I look at the display. The VR app has finished initializing."

    "I start to head back, but--"

    # sfx of someone tripping over something and falling flat, like a pizza box or something
    # slide the BG up into a black screen to indicate a fall
    # fade in the room again, window view

    "I rub my elbow, trying to soothe the part of it that had an unfortunate meeting with the ground."

    "What did I trip over?"

    "...a pizza box?"

    "I look around my apartment and, for the first time, notice the state it’s in."

    "It's a filthy mess."

    "...my friends aren't going to react well to this, are they?"

    "I don't even have any food or drinks to offer them - the leftover pizza and coffee sachets ran out days ago."

    "And the light bulb at the front door still needs changing."

    "..."

    "Yeah, my friends will definitely throw a fit."

    "Maybe I should clean up a bit first?"

    # sfx new email! This time it's from work, with subject line "URGENT reply immediately"
    # player has option to read or ignore the email. the basic gist of it is that the MC has missed too many days of work, and the boss will have no choice but reluctantly hire someone new if this goes on.

    # lightning flash and sfx again
    # pause a second or two

    "..."

    "I can do it tomorrow."

    "Just… one more time."

    # MC goes back to bed and opens VR scene. Have MC walk around in VR silently a few times first, revisiting all the BGs, before going into Julia's scene.
