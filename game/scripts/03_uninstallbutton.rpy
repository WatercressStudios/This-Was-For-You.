# Uninstall button scene

label uninstallbutton:
    # follows from Julia's scene, where it ends with a prompt for players to click the button

    # sfx of plastic button pressed *click*!
    #sfx "vr_uninstall_click" "click!"

    "..."

    "Nope, still here."

    "It's not like I was expecting anything different; if I really wanted to uninstall this VR world, I’d have done it from outside - and done it already."

    "...Specifically, I'd have done it two years ago - when I crafted this button during the 'Create Your First Item' tutorial."

    "So why am I {b}finally{/b} pushing it?"

    #sfx "vr_uninstall_click" "click!"
    "..."

    "Still nothing."

    "I crafted this button partly because it was amusing, partly in protest of this world; it’s a pale imitation of the real thing, after all."

    "Yes, I was also aware of the irony of creating VR content, in VR, to protest VR..."

    "In all fairness, I was planning to log out right after and let the free trial expire on its own."

    "Too bad my plan was foiled by you, right, Ji-min? You and your judge-y eagle-eyes."

    # note: replace "room" with whatever is more appropriate for the BG
    "Somehow, even from the other end of the beach, you managed to spot all the mistakes in my creation."

    "I didn't even have time to defend my artistic vision before you ran over and snatched it right out my hands, fixing it in the process."

    "You even carved a pretty version of the trashcan icon, replacing my stick-figure."

    "Only after all that did you ask me: ‘why did you make this?’ I remember laughing for a whole minute at that."

    "It was like a scene out of a movie: we were strangers, Ji - yet you ran over and fixed my art like we were friends."

    "And then..."

    "..."

    #sfx "vr_uninstall_click" "click!"
    "I push the button again."

    "Yeah.”

    “Still nothing."

    "Stop."

    "Don't respond to it."

    mc "Can it delete you?"

    voice "03-uninstallbutton-7.mp3" #Cheshire (shiena)
    che "Oh, CH35H1R3 has a great idea: it can {b}summon{/b} me!"

    "Oh hell no. Anything but that."

    # ches looks confused
    voice "03-uninstallbutton-8.mp3" #Cheshire (shiena)
    che "Nya? Is Master trying to delete the button? Want some help?"

    "I cradle the button against my chest instinctively, as if the bot will snatch it out of my hands."

    mc "No."

    "The program stares at me, confused; its algorithms are clearly having trouble parsing my behaviour."

    "{b}I'm{/b} having trouble parsing my behaviour."

    "Why am I still so protective of this? Is it because it’s the first thing we made together?"

    "...Because it’s the thing that started our friendship?"

    "You were {b}aghast{/b} when I finally explained what my Uninstall Button was for - as if you had never met anyone so cynical in your life."

    "So I returned day after day, creating more cynical items just for you; in return, you'd create the silliest things."

    "We'd critique each other's creations for hours. Over time, our perspectives on life changed."

    "For years, we kept up with that tradition, until..."
