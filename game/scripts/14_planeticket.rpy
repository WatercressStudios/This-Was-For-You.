    "Well, here I am again."

    "With one final item, I need to find a quiet place as quickly as possible."

    "I don't want that thing to talk to me again."

    "Holy shit, please make it stop talking."

    "Who thought it would be okay to patch in a shitty catgirl? Jesus."

    "Regardless."

    "I know what I'm going to see next. It's… it's the most important item here."

    "There aren't a lot of memories tied to it."

    "No, no. Just one."

    "Finding it where I last left it, I-" #Interrupt

    "I… I don't understand."

    mc "...why?"

    voice "14-planeticket-8.mp3" #Cheshire (shiena)
    che "Whys?"

    mc "She's your creator?"

    voice "14-planeticket-9.mp3" #Cheshire (shiena)
    che "Yeppers!"

    mc "Why?"

    mc "Why did she create you?"

    "Why would she create something like this?"

    voice "14-planeticket-10.mp3" #Cheshire (shiena)
    che "She saids that you'd enjoy my company, nya!"

    mc "Like hell I woul - oh."

    "It actually {b}is{/b} a sick joke. God dammit Ji. Even in death you troll me."

    "I guess that is something she'd do. Design your pathing to follow us around, just to fuck with me."

    "That explains why she'd enjoy you and why I {b}definitely{/b} wouldn't."

    "She made you that way on purpose."

    "It'd be a really funny joke if she were here. A really convoluted, stupid joke with very little payoff. The type of joke she loved to play."

    "I'd get angry, she'd laugh and laugh, I'd tell her she owes me for putting me through this."

    "She'd buy me a drink at the cafe. Eventually, it'd be something funny to reminisce about."

    "Now it's just sick."

    "Now it's just cruel."

    "So you're what's left. You're the last item she created, aren't you?"

    "Of course you would be."

    "Of fucking course."

    "...You're what's left of her."

    "You're all that's left of her."

    mc "I'm sorry."

    che "Sorrys, CH35H1R3 doesn't knows how to responds to that!"

    mc "I'm saying that I'm sorry for the way I've treated you."

    voice "14-planeticket-12.mp3" #Cheshire (shiena)
    che "Sorrys, CH35H1R3 doesn't knows how to responds to that!"

    "Hah, CH35H1R3 doesn't have a programmed response to that. Ji never expected me to say sorry to it, did she?"

    "It'd take something truly incredible to get me to say sorry to this monstrosity."

    "Something tragic."

    "She didn't expect to die, no one did."

    "I pull the item out from my inventory, where it's been since that day."

    "The plane ticket."

    "Your plane ticket."

    "I step back, collapsing against my bed behind me, the VR headset angrily alerting me that I'm out of bounds."

    "My tears pool in the headset, and I'm forced to run my fingers underneath the padding, letting them run."

    "I desperately try to cover my cold skin, forcing my head between my legs."

    "The pain in my chest won't go away. It never goes away."

    "My breathing catches in my throat."

    "The weight of the world crashes around me, and I'm forced to deal with the futility of it all."

    "Everything's just an echo of what you left behind."

    "None of it's real anymore. Nothing is real without you."

    "God, I remember the trip to the airport. My heart was beating so quickly - I would finally see you in person!"

    "We'd get to do everything we always used to talk about."

    "The drive was so long."

    "I was speeding there just to see you. Of course, I was there well ahead of time, but I'd never tell you that."

    "\"I'm boarding my final flight! I'm soooo excited to see you! You better be there to pick me up ;)\""

    "\"We're taking off, I have to turn off my phone! See you soon!!!\"" #Mirror the voicemail when inputting the last sentence here

    "I waited at the gate for hours. Your flight was delayed, and I figured that was normal. Of course the flight was delayed - probably some weather issues in the Pacific, right?"

    "But minutes turned to hours, and your plane never landed."

    "And they never found your body."

    "I stayed there at the gate for days, hoping it was some cruel joke."

    "Planes are supposed to be safe, right?"

    "I was more likely to die on the car ride over, statistically speaking."

    "A plane lost in the Pacific, never to be found."

    "I still have nightmares about it - how it must have felt, knowing you were going to die buried in a metal casket deep in the cold, dark ocean."

    "I should have died."

    "It should have been me on that plane."

    "It should have been me."

    "You always made all of the effort, and that wasn't fair."

    "It never should have been you."

    "If I would have just made the commitment, if I would have been the one to fly over, we'd both be alive. We'd be enjoying ourselves in a cafe in Seoul."

    "You'd have met me at the gate, and we'd enjoy a short drive home. Even with a little jetlag, I'd be itching to do something with you."

    "We'd, I dunno, go to a restaurant? Maybe eat some sushi?"

    "Just sit and enjoy our time together."

    "You'd ask me how my day went, and I'd give you the answer I always did."

    "Looking up to you, I'd see that same wide, genuine smile you always gave me."

    "Too good for this world. You were always too good for this world."

    "From there, we'd go downtown to get some shopping in. I'd buy some touristy shit, and you'd show me what I should and shouldn't buy."

    "We would enjoy the nightlife together, the busyness of the city, and go home."

    "We'd sit on your couch, huddled under a blanket, watching shows all night long."

    "Shit, our sleeping schedules would be all sorts of fucked."

    "But it wouldn't have mattered. \"I took off work! We can stay up as long as we want!!\""

    "We would fall asleep, your head on my shoulder, the TV autoplaying quietly through the morning."

    "You'd wake up first, as always. Brew some coffee, make me some of your fantastic cocoa, and we'd enjoy breakfast together."

    "Maybe you'd ask me what I thought of your home so far, and I'd tell you how truthfully awesome it all is."

    "We'd talk about the first day we met, and how we never could have imagined that this day would come. The day that we'd see each other in person."

    "That's how strong our bond was. That's how strong our friendship was."

    "But none of that will ever happen."

    "You're dead."
